This is the code repository for a demonstration Drupal 8 project.

This repository can be deployed on Pantheon via the Circle CI service, following the instructions in Pantheon's [Build Tools](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/) tutorial. It leverages the Terminus and Composer CLI tools, as well as unit tests from Behat and code linting on Circle CI.

The badges at the top of this page will take you to the relevant resources and the running website.

If you have any questions, please contact Matt directly.
